## dds-ktx: Portable single header DDS/KTX reader for C/C++
[@septag](https://twitter.com/septagh)

- Parses from memory blob. No allocations
- No dependencies
- Single-header for easy integration
- Overridable libc functions 

### Build Example (ctexview)
[**ctexview**](ctexview/ctexview.c) is a tiny ddx-ktx viewer that can be built on linux/mac and windows. To build it just compile the single file with your compiler.

Windows:
```
cl ctexview.c /O2
```

Linux:
```
gcc ctexview.c -O2 -lGL -ldl -lX11 -lXi -lXcursor -lm -o ctexview
```

to view images just provide the image path as an argument:

```
ctexview [dds_or_ktx_image_file_path]
```

Used open-source libraries for app creation/graphics: [**Sokol**](https://github.com/floooh/sokol)

**Keys:**

- UP/DOWN: change current mipmap
- Apostrophe: change text color
- F: Next cube-map face
- R: Toggle Red channel
- G: Toggle Green channel
- B: Toggle Blue channel
- A: Toggle Alpha channel

### Usage
In this example, a simple 2D texture is parsed and created using OpenGL

```c
#define DDSKTX_IMPLEMENT
#include "dds-ktx.h"

int size;
void* dds_data = load_file("test.dds", &size);
assert(dds_data);
ddsktx_texture_info tc = {0};
GLuint tex = 0;
if (ddsktx_parse(&tc, dds_data, size, NULL)) {
    assert(tc.depth == 1);
    assert(!(tc.flags & STC_TEXTURE_FLAG_CUBEMAP));
    assert(tc.num_layers == 1);

    //Create GPU texture from tc data
    glGenTextures(1, &tex);
    glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
    glBindTexture(img->gl_target, tex);

    for (int mip = 0; mip < tc->num_mips; mip++) {
        ddsktx_sub_data sub_data;
        ddsktx_get_sub(&tc, &sub_data, dds_data, size, 0, 0, mip);
        // Fill/Set texture sub resource data (mips in this case)
        if (ddsktx_format_compressed(tc.format))
            glCompressedTexImage2D(..);
        else
            glTexImage2D(..);
    }

    // Now we can delete file data
    free(dds_data);
}
```

### TODO

- Write KTX/DDS
- Read KTX metadata. currently it just stores the offset/size to the metadata block
  
### Others

- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) - Single header library that loads images (.png, .jpg, .bmp, etc)
- [bimg](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bimg) - Extensive C++ image library

**NOTE**: Many parts of the code is taken from _bimg_ library.
